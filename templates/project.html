      <p class="card-text">This application was created with the intention of helping underclassmen at the University of Washington navigate through the different majors offered by providing an in-depth explanation of how the application process works. Our group of four decided to include a section with peer feedback to give students the opportunity to view how others have rated classes they may be interested in taking.
